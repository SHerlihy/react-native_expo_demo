# React Native Expo Demo

A React Native Expo app built through Metas React Native course on Coursera [MetaReactNative](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-native-course).

I've personally added wrapping components for the background and text to provide themed colors based on the users device preferences.

I've also implemented my own drawer header to be a pressable component that spans the entire header area.

## Get started

1. Use Node 22

   ```bash
   nvm use 22
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npm run start
   ```
